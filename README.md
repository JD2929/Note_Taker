# Note_Taker

##Purpose
This app is to take notes (with a title) and keep them for reference later. 

##Usage
Once in the app simply click on the blue "get started" button and you will be taken to the notes area. Here you will see any notes you have taken in the past, and have the opportunity to write a new note. Once your new note is complete, don't forget to click on the "save" icon so that it will be stored for later use.
